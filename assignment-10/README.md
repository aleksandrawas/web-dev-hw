Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

I picked an examples from the "creative writings" pack about the sinking Titanic. The article was published in The New York Times so the font I used was in the serif family called Noto Serif TC. I chose this font because of its classic and sophisticated look which I though would fit well with a high-end magazine.

What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

System font- font included with operating system.
A web font- online hosted font that is embedded into your HTML and CSS files.
A web-safe font- regardless of your operating system web-safe font is one that most browsers support
It is important to have fallback fonts for your font choice so that if one fails to display the second one will be available.
