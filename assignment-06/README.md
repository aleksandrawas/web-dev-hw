The main form I've see on the web are email subscribe forms. These forms link hosts of the website to their users and potential customers.

Text inputs are used when posting a comment on youtube, for example.
Inputing  selection is used when a dropdown menu comes up to allow you to select out of many options, like when googling a word.
An example of button input is "I'm feeling Lucky" button in Google search.

My work cycle for this assignment begin with finding a store, it's address, hours of operations, and their email. Next, I opened Atom and begin building the site. I struggled a bit with the flow because there is a lot of elements that go into separating each table cell and the form. Lastly, I found the submit button on google images.
