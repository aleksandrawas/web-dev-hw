Divs structure content of the pages.
Ids, or "global identifier", give a unique identity to a specific element.
Classes, much like ids, give identity value but they are responsible to group similar types of elements together using the same name value.
Spans are elements that identify text that needs to appear visually unique on the rendered HTML page.

"Alt text" is text that's displayed when there is a problem showing an element like the video. We use it provide information to a user or viewer what can not see the element.

For this assignment, I used the online tools to help me guide through the codes. I added site comments to help me stay organized behind the scenes. For the first time going through I did not use the embedded code, rather just the url and couldn't figure out why. I thought it was awesome that on Sound Cloud when embedding the audio you could choose to set it to automatically play when the site opens.
