<pre>
  <br>
<p>  We been quiet
Said we'd try it
For a while
But that was years ago

If you see me, if I see you
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still, I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you

Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time

Hometown drivin'
Autopilot
My phone's on silent
In case you call

If you see me, if I see you
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still, I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you

Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time, time, time, time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
