Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
The course has thought me a lot of what GitHub is and how to use it. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Repositories were also unfamiliar to me.

Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I have learned a huge amount about everything there is to know about building a basic website. The most challenging concept to me was the concept of ids, classes, and other grouping codes. These codes allow manipulating the design of unordered lists and unique elements.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
1. Utilize previous assignments and piece them together.
2. Go one HTML site by one to double check for unnecessary codes and to organize the code that will correspond with the flow of the website.
3. I struggled with the font code and getting it to work in an organized matter. I used Google Fonts and used help from W3Schools.com to piece it together.
4. I added audio to my About page to make it more personalized.
5. Another thing that gave me a rough time, for no reason at all, was centering all the content. It was a great feeling to get it all working!
6. I went back to the list of what the site must contain and made sure that all the boxes were checked off.
