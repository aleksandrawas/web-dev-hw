There only can be one body and head element per one page. The body shows everything that is displayed on the main browser window. The head contains information about the page, like the title.

Structural markup is the literal structure displayed on the page, such as paragraphs and breaks between lines.
Semantic markup is the information that link to cites, documents, or images outside of the page.

My workflow begin with opening the book and looking through the pictures guiding me through the elements I needed in the index document (I am a visual person and those were the most help.) I also referred back to the website with the assignment help.
