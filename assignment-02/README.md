### Why I took this class:
The reason I took this class was to develop a better understanding of the online world of developers. I have my own website which was created on a platform that designed most of the content for me. I would love to know how to build my own website and/or understand the codes behind the website I already own.

### Three things I've learned:

Internet is a tangible phenomena.

HTTP is a language used to communicate between web browsers and servers.

HTML is a language used to tell a web browser how to design a page.
